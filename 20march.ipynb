    "Q1. What is data encoding? How is it useful in data science?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data encoding is the process of converting categorical data into a numerical format that machine learning algorithms can understand. Categorical data represents groups or categories and doesn't have an inherent numerical value. Data encoding is essential in data science because many machine learning algorithms require numerical input, and encoding allows us to represent categorical features in a way that algorithms can process.\n",

    "2. What is nominal encoding? Provide an example of how you would use it in a real-world scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal encoding, also known as label encoding, assigns a unique integer value to each category in a categorical feature. It's typically used for categorical variables where the categories don't have a natural order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In a dataset of car models, you could use nominal encoding to convert the \"Make\" feature, which includes categories like \"Toyota,\" \"Ford,\" and \"Honda,\" into numerical labels (e.g., 0 for Toyota, 1 for Ford, 2 for Honda).\n",

    "Q3. In what situations is nominal encoding preferred over one-hot encoding? Provide a practical example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal encoding is preferred over one-hot encoding when the categorical feature has a large number of unique categories, as one-hot encoding would create a large number of binary features, leading to the curse of dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In a dataset of movie genres, where there are many unique genres like \"Action,\" \"Comedy,\" \"Drama,\" etc., nominal encoding would be preferred over one-hot encoding to avoid creating numerous binary features.\n",

    "For the \"species\" feature, I would use one-hot encoding because each species is a distinct category with no ordinal relationship, and one-hot encoding can represent each category as a binary column.
